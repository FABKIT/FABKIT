              **What Happens Next?**

              1. **Community Discussion**: Feature requests are often discussed in the community before implementation
              2. **Evaluation**: We'll evaluate the request based on project goals, technical feasibility, and resources
              3. **Roadmap**: Accepted features will be added to our roadmap and assigned to future milestones
              4. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of the status and any decisions made

              **Note:** Not all feature requests can be implemented immediately. We prioritise based on community needs, project direction, and available development time.
